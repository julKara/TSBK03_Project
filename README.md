# TSBK03_Project
Source code of my project for the course TSBK03 Teknik för avancerade datorspel taught at Linköping Univeristy. Check within the "OpenGLApplication" folder for source-ocde (I know, amazing name).

## Some current issues
* All things `Bullet`-related (used for physics-sim) doesn't work. Can't get bullet to generate dll-files, and therefore, it cant be used in the prject either. 
* No functional ragdoll-sim due to the previous issue and time-constraint.

## Poseble issues
* I've pushed some *.vs* files to github before creating a **gitignore**
